# ArcGIS Enterprise SDK API References

This section covers ArcGIS Enterprise SDK API references for .NET and Java. The .NET API reference covers .NET assemblies available in the ArcGIS Enterprise SDK for .NET developers. The Java API reference serves as reference documentation for the classes, interfaces, and methods contained within the arcgis-enterprise-sdk.jar file for Java developers.

Both .NET and Java APIs have similar classes, interfaces, and methods, and they can achieve similar functionalities. The major difference is that ArcGIS Enterprise on Linux environment only supports Java SOEs/SOIs, whereas ArcGIS Enterprise on Windows environment supports both .NET and Java SOEs/SOIs. Java SOEs/SOIs developed on Windows machines can also be deployed on Linux machines.
