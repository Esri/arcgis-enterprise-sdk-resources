# Develop REST SOEs

REST SOEs can be created or built either from the Maven `archetype:generate` command, or from a Java integrated development environment (IDE). This section walks you through how to build REST SOEs using IntelliJ, Eclipse, and the Maven command.

- [Build REST SOEs using Eclipse](../build-rest-soes-using-eclipse/)
- [Build REST SOEs using the Maven command](../build-rest-soes-using-the-maven-command/)

Last, this section also discusses how to implement the interfaces in REST SOEs to achieve business logic. Refer to [Implement the REST SOE's Interfaces](../implement-the-rest-soes-interfaces/).
