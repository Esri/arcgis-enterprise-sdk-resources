# How to deploy the REST SOE

Before others can use your server object extension (SOE), you need to deploy it to ArcGIS Server. You can deploy the SOE in a few simple steps using ArcGIS Server Manager. You'll need to reference the .soe file that was created in your project bin directory when you built the project. If you're deploying the SOE on another machine, copy the .soe file to that machine.

### Deploying the SOE

Follow these steps to deploy the Spatial Query REST SOE to ArcGIS Server:

1.  Log into ArcGIS Server Manager and click Site.
2.  Click Extensions.
3.  Click Add Extension.
4.  Click Browse and browse to your SpatialQueryREST.soe file. (This file was placed in your project's bin directory when you built your project.)
5.  Click Add.

Now that the SOE is deployed, it will be available for publishers to enable on their map services.
