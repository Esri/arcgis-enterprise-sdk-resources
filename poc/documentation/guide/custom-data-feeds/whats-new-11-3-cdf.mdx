## User interfaces in ArcGIS Server Manager to manage custom data providers and create custom data feed feature services

New user interfaces were added in ArcGIS Server Manager to manage custom data providers (register, update, and delete) 
and create custom data feed feature services with parameters. Refer to documentation on 
[managing custom data provider](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/develop/windows/administer-custom-data-providers-using-server-manager.htm) 
and [creating custom data feed](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/publish-services/windows/about-service-definition-files.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_28830F549A904DD9A42CE01C79F0E76B) 
feature service using ArcGIS Server Manager.


## Support for “pbf” response format for the layer level query operation in custom data feed feature services

Custom data feeds feature services now support PBF as a response format for the layer level query operation. 
ArcGIS clients (such as ArcGIS Pro, Map Viewer, etc.) can request responses in PBF format when querying a
custom data feeds feature service. By default, `supportedQueryFormats` will include `JSON, geoJSON, PBF` for 
custom data feed feature services.

 
## Two new commands in custom data feed command line tool - Register, Unregister

Two new commands were added in the custom data feeds command line tool to 
register/unregister custom data providers and create/delete feature 
services associated with custom data providers.
