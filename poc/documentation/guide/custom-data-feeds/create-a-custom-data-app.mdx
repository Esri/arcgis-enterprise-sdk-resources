  Create a custom data app
---

A _custom data app_ is a Node.js project that can contain one or more
custom data providers. A custom data app allows you to test your data
providers without having to package and deploy them to ArcGIS Server.

Complete the following steps to create a custom data app.

1.  Open a command prompt, and navigate to the directory where you want
    to create a custom data app.

2.  Run the `cdf createapp <name>` command. This creates a directory named
    with the value you supplied for **_\<name\>_**.

3.  Open the newly created directory in an IDE of your choice. You should see the following
    folder structure.

    ```
    - config/
        | default.json
    - framework/
        | cache-memory/
        | core/
        | featureserver/
        | logger/
        | output-geoservices/
        | winnow/
    - node_modules/
    - src/
        - request-handlers/
            | welcome-page.js
        | index.js
        | plugins.js
        | routes.js
    - cdconfig.json
    - package-lock.json
    - package.json
    ```

4.  Open a command prompt in the app directory and run the `npm
    start` command to start the app. You will see a message that
    the _Server is listening at 8080_.
