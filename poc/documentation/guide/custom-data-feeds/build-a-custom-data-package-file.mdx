# Build a Custom Data Package File

Your custom data provider must be bundled into a custom data package
file (**.cdpk**) in order to deploy it to ArcGIS Server. To build a **.cdpk**
file, your provider must have a valid **cdconfig.json** file in the root of
the custom data provider directory. The **cdconfig.json** file is generated when you create a
custom data provider using the `createprovider` command. Below are the
auto-generated contents of the file.

```json
{
  "name": "<name-of-provider>",
  "arcgisVersion": "11.3.0",
  "parentServiceType": "FeatureServer",
  "customdataRuntimeVersion": "1",
  "type": "provider",
  "properties": {
    "hosts": true,
    "disableIdParam": false
  }
}

```

Change the values of the `hosts` and `disableIdParam` fields depending
on whether your provider requires the `host` and `id` URL parameters. To
package your provider into a **.cdpk** file, run
the `cdf export <name> `command at the command line in the
custom data app directory.

After the **.cdpk** file has been successfully created, the contents of 
**cdconfig.json** are again updated to the reflect the file name of your 
new **.cdpk** file as seen below.

```json
{
  "name": "<name-of-provider>",
  "arcgisVersion": "11.3.0",
  "parentServiceType": "FeatureServer",
  "customdataRuntimeVersion": "1",
  "type": "provider",
  "properties": {
    "hosts": true,
    "disableIdParam": false
  },
  "fileName": "<name-of-provider>.cdpk"
}

```
