## Overview

The SOE samples and SOI samples in this repository are also included with the installation of ArcGIS Enterprise SDK. It's located at `<ArcGIS_Enterprise_SDK_Installation_Path>\Samples`, by default, `C:\Program Files\ArcGIS\EnterpriseSDK\Samples`.

> Note: This repository contains SOE and SOI samples built with **11.3**, the latest version of ArcGIS Enterprise SDK. If you want to download the SOE and SOI samples built with 11.2 or previous versions of ArcGIS Enterprise SDK, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-enterprise-sdk-resources/releases).

The sample data used to publish the testing services can be found at `<ArcGIS_Enterprise_SDK_Installation_Path>\Samples\EnterpriseSDKSampleData.zip`, by default, `C:\Program Files\ArcGIS\EnterpriseSDK\Samples\EnterpriseSDKSampleData.zip`.

The following three services are used in the samples:
1. **USA map service**
    1. Open an ArcGIS Pro map.
    2. Add the Cities, Highways, Counties, and State feature classes from usa.gdb (`...\EnterpriseSDKSampleData\data\usa\usa.gdb`) to the map.
    3. Share the map as a web layer. Make sure the Map Image option is checked for Layer Type.
    4. Publish the service

2. **Vegetation map service**
    1. Open an ArcGIS Pro map.
    2. Add the veg feature class from veg.gdb (`...\EnterpriseSDKSampleData\Yellowstone\veg.gdb`) to the map.
    3. Share the map as a web layer. Make sure the Map Image option is checked for Layer Type.
    4. Publish the service
    
3. **Naperville service**

    This service is used to test with the [utility network tracing REST SOE](dot%20net/SOE/UNTracingRESTSOE), which is available since 10.8.1. You can follow the instructions at [Electric Utility Network Foundation](https://solutions.arcgis.com/electric/help/electric-utility-network-foundation/) to load the Naperville demo data in an Enterprise Geodatabase and publish it as the NapervilleElectricFoundation service on ArcGIS Enterprise.
