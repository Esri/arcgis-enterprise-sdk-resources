# Consume secured SOAP services

This section provides a sample project [Secured SOAP Client App](securedsoapclientapp), which illustrates how to create a Java application that consumes a secured SOAP map service.

In this project, there are two modules:

- [SoapMapServiceStubGen](securedsoapclientapp/SoapMapServiceStubGen)
- [SecuredMapServiceSoapClient](securedsoapclientapp/SecuredMapServiceSoapClient)

The first module generates the SOAP proxy libraries to consume the secured map service. The second module contains a client application that references the generated proxy libraries to call the SOAP methods of the secured map services.

You can read [Secured SOAP Client App](securedsoapclientapp) for more details.
