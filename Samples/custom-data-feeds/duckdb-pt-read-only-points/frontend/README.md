# Frontend
This is a simple html file that uses the ArcGIS JS API to render a web map in the browser. We can point the web map to a featureserver (in this case we point it to a localhost url of our cdf app running locally). In future CDF/EnterpriseSDK versions, https will be supported so a CDF running locally can be pulled directly into a AGOL webmap (and thus this html file will no longer be required)

If you want to use ArcGIS Pro instead of a web map you can add the 127.0.0.1 feature server url as a data path. The only downside with this is you don't get access to the chrome dev tools to be able to inspect requests going to your server.
