# NET API Reference

This section covers documentation for each .NET namespaces available in the ArcGIS Enterprise SDK. The ArcGIS Enterprise SDK namespace reference is the definitive source for learning how to program ArcGIS Enterprise SDK-based extensions. Understanding how to find information in the ArcGIS Enterprise SDK namespace reference helps you create .NET based extensions in a timely manner. This topic series gives .NET developers strategies to find the right information in over 10,000 ArcGIS Enterprise SDK classes and how to translate what is read into .NET-based code.
Below is a brief description of each .NET assembly available in the ArcGIS Enterprise SDK. These assemblies also get registered in the Global Assembly Cache (GAC) during installation of the ArcGIS Enterprise SDK.

| Namespace                                                                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| [ESRI.ArcGIS.Carto](/api-reference/net/Carto_library/)                                   | Provides the key interfaces for working with the MapServer. You will find interfaces for layers, tables, and information about the map service such as extent and scale information. It's also the starting point for getting access to the underlying data.                                                                                                                                    |
| [ESRI.ArcGIS.DatasourcesFile](/api-reference/net/DataSourcesFile_library/)               | Typically, you will access data already being referenced by a service, but if you need to open file-based vector data that's independent of the service, then this library may help. It can be used to open workspaces (connections to the files) to shapefiles, TINs, CAD files, and more. Once you have a reference to a dataset, you can use the Geodatabase library to access the features. |
| [ESRI.ArcGIS.DatasourcesGDB](/api-reference/net/DataSourcesGDB_library/)                 | Typically, you will access data already being referenced by the service, but if you need to open an independent file geodatabase, a SQLite database, or an enterprise geodatabase, this library allows you to do so. Once you have a reference to a dataset, you can use the Geodatabase library to access the features.                                                                        |
| [ESRI.ArcGIS.DatasourcesRaster](/api-reference/net/DataSourcesRaster_library/)           | Typically, you will access data already being referenced by the service, but if you need to open raster data not referenced by the service, this library allows you to do so.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [ESRI.ArcGIS.Geodatabase](/api-reference/net/GeoDatabase_library/)                       | Whether you have a reference to the data through your service or you have opened it using one of the DataSources libraries, you will access the data (features and raster) through the geodatabase library.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [ESRI.ArcGIS.GeoDatabaseDistributed](/api-reference/net/GeoDatabaseDistributed_library/) | Typically, you will use this for SOIs that are intercepting WFS requests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [ESRI.ArcGIS.GeoDatabaseExtensions](/api-reference/net/GeoDatabaseExtensions_library/)   | Contains objects to aid in the creation, management, and use of terrain datasets and cadastral fabrics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [ESRI.ArcGIS.Geometry](/api-reference/net/Geometry_library/)                             | Provides the interfaces and functions for working with feature geometries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [ESRI.ArcGIS.GISClient](/api-reference/net/GISClient_library/)                           | Provides access to objects for working with remote geographic information system (GIS) services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [ESRI.ArcGIS.Server](/api-reference/net/Server_library/)                                 | Primarily used to get information about an ArcGIS Server and perform administrative operations such as querying logs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
