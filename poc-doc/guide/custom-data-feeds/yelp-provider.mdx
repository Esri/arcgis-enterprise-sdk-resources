# Yelp provider

This sample provider interfaces with the Yelp Fusion API to find local
entities such as restaurants and parks using a valid postal code or city
name. Click [here](./samples/yelp-data-provider.zip) to download the
source code for the provider onto your developer machine. *Note that this 
Yelp sample uses both the `host` and `id` parameters, whereas the [Yelp Walkthrough](../create-a-yelp-custom-data-feed/) demonstrates 
how to setup a similar provider using only `id`.*

## Set up the Provider

1.  Run the `cdf createapp yelp-app` command to create a new custom data
    app or use an existing custom data app.
2.  Run the `cdf createprovider yelp-data-provider` command to create a
    custom data provider.
3.  Navigate to the **providers/yelp-data-provider** directory in a
    command prompt, and run the `npm i yelp-fusion` command.
4.  Copy the contents of the src folder in the provided source code into
    the src folder inside your **providers/yelp-data-provider/src**
    directory.

## Obtain an API Key

1.  Follow the instructions in Yelp Fusion's developer documentation to
    obtain a private API key.

2.  Once you have an API key, specify it in the
    **providers/yelp-data-provider/default.json** file as the value for
    the **yelp.apiKey** field as shown.

    ```json
    {
      "yelp": {
        "apiKey": "<generated API key here>"
      }
    }
    ```

## Configure the Provider

1.  In the **cdconfig.json** file, set the value of the
    `properties.hosts` field to `true` and
    `properties.disabledIdParam` field to `false`. The file is located
    in the **yelp-data-provider** directory.

## Test the Provider

1.  Navigate to the **yelp-app** directory in a command prompt and run
    the `npm start` command to start the custom data app
2.  In a web browser, navigate to
    http://localhost:8080/yelp-data-provider/rest/services/restaurants/92373/FeatureServer/0/query
    and verify that the Yelp provider is returning data points.

## Build and Deploy a Custom Data Provider Package File

1.  Stop the custom data app if it's running.
2.  Open a command prompt and navigate to the custom data app directory.
3.  Run the `cdf export yelp-data-provider` command.
4.  In a web browser, navigate to the ArcGIS Server Administrator
    Directory and sign in as an administrator.
5.  Click **uploads \> upload**.
6.  On the **Upload Item** page, click **Choose File** and select the
    **yelp-data-provider.cdpk** file. Optionally, provide a description
    in the **Description** text box.
7.  Click **Upload**. Once the file is uploaded, you will be directed to
    a page with the following header: **Uploaded item - \<item_id\>** .
    Copy the item id.
8.  Browse back to the root of the Administrator Directory and then
    click **services \> types \> customdataproviders**.
9.  On the **Registered Customdata Providers** page, click register and
    paste the item id into the **Id** of **uploaded item** field.
10. Click **Register**.

## Create Feature Service

1.  Browse back to the root of the Administrator Directory and click
    **services > createService**.

2.  On the **Create Service** page, copy and paste the following JSON
    into the **Service (in JSON format)** text box.

    ```json
    {
      "serviceName": "yelp",
      "type": "FeatureServer",
      "description": "",
      "capabilities": "Query",

      },
      "jsonProperties": {
        "customDataProviderInfo": {

          "dataProviderId": "redlands"
        }
      },
      "extensions": [],
      "frameworkProperties": {},

## Consume Feature Service

To access the yelp feature service that you created in the previous
section, use the appropriate URL (e.g.,
https://\<domain_or_machine_name\>/\<webadaptor_name\>/rest/services/yelp/FeatureServer).
You can use this URL to consume data from Yelp in ArcGIS clients like
ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online, and ArcGIS Enterprise.
