# CSV Provider

This sample provider interfaces with a CSV file published on the web and
integrates the data with ArcGIS Enterprise. Click
[here](./samples/csv-provider.zip) to download the source code for the
provider.

## Set up the Provider

1.  Run the `cdf createapp csv-app` command to create a new custom data
    app, or use an existing custom data app.
2.  Run the `cdf createprovider csv-provider` command to create a custom
    data provider.
3.  Navigate to the **providers/csv-provider** directory in a command
    prompt and run the `npm i node-fetch@2 valid-url papaparse` command.
4.  Copy the contents of the src folder in the provided source code into
    the src folder inside your **providers/csv-provider/src** directory.
5.  Put the **points.csv** file on a web server so that it is available
    through a URL. The file is located in the **data** folder inside the
    **csv-provider** directory.

## Configure the Provider

1.  In the **default.json**, file set the **url** field to the URL where
    the **points.csv** file is hosted. Here's how it should look, but your URL
    value will likely be different.

    ```json
    {
      "csv-provider": {
        "sources": {
          "my-data": {
            "url": "http://localhost/sampledata/points.csv",
            "geometryColumns": {
              "longitude": "longitude",
              "latitude": "latitude"
            },
            "delimiter": ",",
            "metadata": {
              "idField": "id"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

2.  In the **cdconfig.json** file, set the value of the
    `properties.hosts` field to `false` and
    `properties.disableIdParam` field to `false`. The file is located
    in the **csv-provider** directory.

## Test the Provider

1.  Navigate to the **csv-app** directory in a command prompt, and run
    the `npm start` command to start the custom data app.
2.  In a web browser, navigate
    to\>http://localhost:8080/csv-provider/rest/services/my-data/FeatureServer/0/query,
    and verify that the provider is returning data points.

## Build and Deploy the Custom Data Provider Package File

1.  Stop the custom data app, if it is currently running.
2.  Open a command prompt, and navigate to the custom data app directory.
3.  Run the `cdf export csv-provider` command.
4.  In a web browser, navigate to the ArcGIS Server Administrator
    Directory, and sign in as an administrator.
5.  Click **uploads \> upload**.
6.  On the **Upload Item** page, click **Choose File**, and select the
    **csv-provider.cdpk** file. Optionally, provide a description in the
    **Description** text box.
7.  Click **Upload**. Once the file is uploaded, you will be directed to
    a page with the following header: **Uploaded item - \<item_id\>** .
    Copy the item id.
8.  Browse back to the root of the Administrator Directory and then
    click **services \> types \> customdataproviders**.
9.  On the **Registered Customdata Providers** page, click the **register** link and 
    then paste the item id into the **Id** of **uploaded item** field.
10. Click the **Register** button.

## Create Feature Service

1.  Browse back to the root of the Administrator Directory and click
    **services \> createService**.

2.  On the **Create Service** page, copy and paste the following JSON
    into the **Service (in JSON format)** text box.

    ```json
    {
      "serviceName": "csv",
      "type": "FeatureServer",
      "description": "",
      "capabilities": "Query",
      "provider": "CUSTOMDATA",
      "clusterName": "default",
      "minInstancesPerNode": 0,
      "maxInstancesPerNode": 0,
      "instancesPerContainer": 1,
      "maxWaitTime": 60,
      "maxStartupTime": 300,
      "maxIdleTime": 1800,
      "maxUsageTime": 600,
      "loadBalancing": "ROUND_ROBIN",
      "isolationLevel": "HIGH",
      "configuredState": "STARTED",
      "recycleInterval": 24,
      "recycleStartTime": "00:00",
      "keepAliveInterval": 1800,
      "private": false,
      "isDefault": false,
      "maxUploadFileSize": 0,
      "allowedUploadFileTypes": "",
      "properties": {
        "disableCaching": "true"
      },
      "jsonProperties": {
        "customDataProviderInfo": {
          "dataProviderName": "csv-provider",
          "dataProviderHost": "",
          "dataProviderId": "my-data"
        }
      },
      "extensions": [],
      "frameworkProperties": {},
      "datasets": []
    }
    ```

3.  Click **Create.**

## Consume Feature Service

To access the csv feature service that you created in the previous
section, use the appropriate URL (e.g.,
https://\<domain_or_machine_name\>/\<webadaptor_name\>/rest/services/csv/FeatureServer).
You can use this URL to consume data from your CSV file in ArcGIS
clients like ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online, and ArcGIS Enterprise.
