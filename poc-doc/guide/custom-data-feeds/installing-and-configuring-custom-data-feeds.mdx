# Install and Configure ArcGIS Server Custom Data Feeds

The following steps will guide you through the ArcGIS Server Custom Data Feeds installation and configuration process.

1.  Install ArcGIS Server, and create an ArcGIS Server site on your server machine.
2.  Install the same version of ArcGIS Server Custom Data Feeds Runtime as the version ArcGIS Server on your server machine. If there are multiple machines in your ArcGIS Server site, then the ArcGIS Server Data Feeds Runtime must be installed on each machine.
3.  Install an appropriate version of Node.js runtime and the ArcGIS Enterprise SDK on the machine where you will do your development. See the table below for supported version of Node.js. The Custom Data Feeds command line tool is inlcuded in the ArcGIS Enterprise SDK. This development machine does not need to have ArcGIS Server installed.

    *It is highly recommend that your development machine and server machine are running the same operating system and the same version of Node.js. 
    This development machine does not need to have ArcGIS Enterprise or AcGIS Server installed on it.*

    |Product                  | Version   |Node.js version(s) | Notes       |
    |------------------------ |-----------|------------------ |------------- |
    |CDF Command Line Tool    | 11.1      |14.13.1 - 16.19.1  | Any Node.js version in this range is suitable.
    |ArcGIS Server            | 11.1      |16.19.1            | ArcGIS Server 11.1 ships with Node.js v16.19.1
    |CDF Command Line Tool    | 11.2      |16.16.2 - 18.17.0  | Any Node.js version in this range is suitable.
    |ArcGIS Server            | 11.2      |18.17.0            | ArcGIS Server 11.2 ships with Node.js v18.17.1
    |CDF Command Line Tool    | 11.3      |18.17.1 - 20.11.1  | Any Node.js version in this range is suitable.
    |ArcGIS Server            | 11.3      |20.11.1            | ArcGIS Server 11.3 ships with Node.js v20.11.1

    If you need to maintain different versions of Node.js on your development machine, consider using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (Linux) or [NVM for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)

4.  Open a command prompt on your development machine, and run the command: `cdf -h`. The following output should appear:
