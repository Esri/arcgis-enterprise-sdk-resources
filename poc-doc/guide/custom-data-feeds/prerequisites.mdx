  Custom Data feed Prerequisites
---

# Prerequisites

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) before following this how-to
guide. Custom Data Feeds (CDF) currently supports versions of Node.js between *v16.19.1* and *v20.11.1*.  

_Node.js version 20.11.1 is highly recommended because this version ships with ArcGIS Server 11.3. If you
need to have other version of Node.js installed on your development machine, consider using
[NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (Linux) or [NVM for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) (Windows)
to switch your version while developing._

1.  Verify successful Node.js installation and the version. In a terminal, run the command: `node -v`

2.  Install the CDF CLI tool. To do this, refer to step 3 in
    [Installing and configuring](../installing-and-configuring-custom-data-feeds/).

3.  Verify successful installation of CDF CLI tool. In a terminal, run the command: `cdf -h`

If the CDF tool is configured, then the following output will appear:

```
