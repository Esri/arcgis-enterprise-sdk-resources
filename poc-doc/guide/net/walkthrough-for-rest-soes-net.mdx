# Walkthrough for REST SOEs


This walkthrough takes you through the process of developing a server object extension (SOE) as a REST web service. The advantage of using a REST web service is that it allows your SOE to be consumed by ArcGIS application programming interfaces (APIs) for JavaScript, Runtime APIs, and other platforms.

This walkthrough consists of the following associated topics:

-   [How to develop the REST SOE](../how-to-develop-the-rest-soe-net/)
-   [How to deploy the REST SOE](../how-to-deploy-the-rest-soe-net/)
-   [How to develop a property page for the REST SOE](../how-to-develop-a-property-page-net/)
-   [How to enable and test the REST SOE on a service](../how-to-enable-and-test-net/)
