# Develop SOEs with REST and SOAP support

If you would like to create an SOE that supports both REST and SOAP functions, it's recommended that you start creating the project from `rest-soap-soe-archetype`. This archetype is identified by the following properties:

- GroupId: `com.esri.arcgis.enterprise.sdk`
- ArtifactId: `rest-soap-soe-archetype`
- Version: `11.3.0` (use `11.3.0` for 11.3.0 SDK and `11.2.0` for 11.2.0 SDK)

The process for creating an SOE project using `rest-soap-soe-archetype` is similar to using `soap-soe-archetype`, and you can follow the instructions for SOAP SOEs as a reference and replace `soap-soe-archetype` with `rest-soap-soe-archetype` in your steps:

- [Build SOAP SOEs using IntelliJ](../build-soap-soes-using-intellij/)
- [Build SOAP SOEs using Eclipse](../build-soap-soes-using-eclipse/)
- [Build SOAP SOEs using the Maven command](../build-soap-soes-using-the-maven-command/)

> Note: It's recommended that you do not create an SOE that supports both REST and SOAP functions using `rest-soe-archetype` and then implementing the SOAP interface, as the `rest-soe-archetype` does not contain the required plugins and dependencies, and manually adding them is likely to cause errors.
