# Install ArcGIS Eclipse plugin

This topic discusses the installation and use of the ArcGIS Eclipse IDE plugins. You can use any Eclipse version. This topic uses Eclipse Photon to explain the process.

### About ArcGIS Eclipse plugin

ArcGIS Eclipse plugin provides the following features:

-   Server object extension and server object interceptor templates. A project template includes all the necessary boilerplate code to begin a specific type of extension development.
-   Wizards to help you create SOEs and SOIs, to extend map service published via ArcGIS Pro, in ArcGIS Enterprise.

**Note:** If you already have the ArcGIS Eclipse plugin imported into your copy of the Eclipse IDE, you don’t need to import the plugin when you install a new ArcGIS SDK. Just close and reopen Eclipse after you’ve installed an SDK. This applies to both the ArcObjects Java SDK and the ArcGIS Enterprise SDK.

### Download and install Eclipse

To install the Eclipse IDE from the Eclipse Web site, see [Eclipse Downloads](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) and install the supported version of Eclipse.

### Install ArcGIS Eclipse plugin

The following will walk you through installing the ArcGIS Eclipse plugin:

**Step 1:** Uninstall existing ArcGIS plugins:

1.  Ensure that the "bin" folder in JDK (Version 1.8.0_191 and above) is added to the PATH environment variable.
2.  Start Eclipse
3.  Click "Help" menu -> "Install New Software…" menu item.
4.  Ensure that no ArcObjects plugins are installed. Click on the "What is already installed?" link in the lower part of the Install wizard:

### Add the ArcGIS Enterprise SDK library

Once you install ArcGIS Enterprise SDK, you can find the ArcGIS Enterprise SDK Java library at **\\&lt;ArcGIS Enterprise SDK Installation folder>\\java\\tools\\arcgis-enterprise-sdk.jar**

For documentation related to the ArcGIS Enterprise SDK Java library refer to [ArcGIS Enterprise SDK JavaDoc](/api-reference/java/) section of this help document.

We strongly recommend that you follow the steps below for adding the ArcGIS Enterprise SDK library to avoid various code compilation issues and extension export issues.

1.  Ensure that the "bin" folder in JDK (Version 1.8.0_191 and above) is added to the PATH environment variable.

2.  Start Eclipse

3.  Click "File" -> "New" -> "Java Project" menu item, to create new Java project in Eclipse

    or

    Click "File" -> "Open Projects from File System" -> menu item, to open an existing Java project in Eclipse. Navigate to the appropriate project folder and add project in Eclipse.

4.  Open the project properties by right-clicking on the project folder in Eclipse and clicking on Properties.
