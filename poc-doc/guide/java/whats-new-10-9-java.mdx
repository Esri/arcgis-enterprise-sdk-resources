# What's new in 10.9

### Network diagram support

ArcGIS Enterprise SDK now provides support for network diagrams SOEs and SOIs. Developers can directly access the diagram dataset related to any published utility network, and then retrieve existing network diagrams, create new network diagrams, and more. See [Work with network diagrams](../../net/work-with-network-diagrams-net).

For a list of new interfaces and classes, refer to [New in 10.9 API](../whats-new-api-10-9-java).
